It is a replication of the Windows 7 which is one of the best operating system microsoft created. It is only develoepd by using only Html, Css, and Java. All rights reserved to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in">Microsoft&reg;</a>

Sharing Experience: It was the most time consuming project of my life until now. It is like a emulator of windows 7 and the fun part is that it can be used as permanent operating system as long as you are connect to the internet. You can even change the theme of desktop as well as create new folders in it.

Note 3.0: I want to develop Graphical User Interface of all Microsoft Windows (Windows XP, 7, 10 and 11). I have already developed GUI's of Windows 10 and 11 and 7. Now I am going to develop Windows XP (GUI). As this the last project of this Windows, I am thinking to make something cool.
